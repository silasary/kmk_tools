# What is Keymaster's Keep?

Keymaster's Keep is a dynamic, multi-game objective/challenge generator that seamlessly integrates with a thematic Archipelago randomizer. In other words, you have a typical Archipelago randomizer with goals, finite locations, progression items, logic etc., and Keymaster's Keep will generate and associate unique game challenges with each location. The APWorld provides increasing monolithic support for games, as well as a dedicated client to assist with the exploration and challenges of Keymaster's Keep.

## When you play Keymaster's Keep...

- You will generate a new keep with distinct areas.
- A few of these areas will be unlocked from the start.
- The rest will be locked and will require combinations of *Magic Keys* to unlock.
- These *Magic Keys* are scattered throughout the multiworld.

- Once an area is unlocked, a set of trials for a specific game will be revealed.
- For each trial you complete, you will manually check it off in the client and that will correspond to a location check.
- Your goal will either be to collect enough *Artifacts of Resolve* to unlock a final challenge to beat, or to escape the keep with a certain number of *Magic Keys* or *Conquest Medallions* in hand.
