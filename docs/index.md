Welcome to the incomplete codex of Keymaster's Keep games.

It aims to give a quick impression of what games exist, and what kind of tasks they'll give you, without the need to dig through a lot of source code.

Objectives marked with ⚠️ are **Difficult**, and those with ⌛ are **Time Consuming**.

Objective lists are generated with default YAML options. This codex makes no attempt to figure out what happens if you change them.

First time here? Check out **[What is Keymaster's Keep?](what_is_keymasters/)**, and then read the **[Installation](installation/)** guide.
